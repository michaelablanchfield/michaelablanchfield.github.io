		I sell some of my 3D models online on <a href="https://sketchfab.com/michaelablanchfield/models">Sketchfab</a> and <a href="https://www.cgtrader.com/michaelablanchfield">CGTrader</a>. What I sell currently are mostly set with an Editorial licence. Editorial licenses are for content where I created the model based on real-life copyrighted objects and that I do not own the original design or associated brand or logo copyright. These types of models can be used for non-commercial projects such as news items or documentaries.
