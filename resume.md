# Résumé 

I am Michaela Blanchfield, a virtual artist and game designer living in Dublin, Ireland. I am driven to hone
my craft, master the tools of my trade, work towards the cutting-edge and succeed at ever-more ambitious
projects. I have a keen interest in pursuing and creating 3D assets that are visually beautiful. I am a firm
believer that ensuring the quality of both of these technical and visual elements of a project will result in a
happier team and a great product overall. I am excited by the future of virtual art as it crosses over between
games, movies, television and virtual reality experiences as it is enjoyed by millions of people. I like to work
hard, be challenged, make my contribution and consistently improve my skills. If I can do this at your
company, then I would be interested in working with you. I have always had a passion for the artistic and
visual aspect of game development, and I always strive to bring originality into my work. My long-term goal
is to build a successful career as a virtual artist in the games industry.
