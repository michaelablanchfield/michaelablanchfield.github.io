		My favourite hobby is making 3D game assets. I like to think that I specialise in architectural and inorganic objects, particularly of the gothic, medieval and vintage kind. I always catch myself admiring such architecture I stumble across in the real world and mulling it over in my head regarding how I would go about modelling such thing. Having just recently graduated university with a 1st Class Honours in Game Design, I'm trilled to finally have more recreational time to dedicate myself more to my virtual artwork. I'm always collecting photos of things I like the look of as references and inspiration for future art pieces. Eventually I hope to start selling my 3D models online once I deem my skills to have advanced sufficiently for them to be worthy enough of a pricetag.
